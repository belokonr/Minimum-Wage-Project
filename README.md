# Replication: Minimum Wages and Employment in the Fast-Food Industry

A replication of Card and Krueger's (1994) landmark study on the employment effects of New Jersey's 1992 minimum wage increase on the fast-food industry.

## Original Study

**Card, D., & Krueger, A. B. (1994).** Minimum Wages and Employment: A Case Study of the Fast-Food Industry in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. *The American Economic Review*, 84(4), 772–793.

The original paper exploits the April 1, 1992 increase in New Jersey's minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.05 per hour, using fast-food restaurants in eastern Pennsylvania (where the minimum wage remained at $4.25) as a control group. The authors surveyed 410 Burger King, KFC, Wendy's, and Roy Rogers restaurants in two waves — before (February–March 1992) and after (November–December 1992) the policy change — and found no evidence that the higher minimum wage reduced employment.

## Project Overview

This project replicates the core empirical results of Card and Krueger (1994), including:

- **Difference-in-differences estimates** of the effect of the minimum wage on full-time-equivalent (FTE) employment (Table 3)
- **Reduced-form regression models** for employment changes using the New Jersey dummy and the initial wage gap variable (Table 4)
- **Specification tests and robustness checks** across alternative employment measures and sample restrictions (Table 5)
- **Price effect analysis** estimating the pass-through of higher labor costs to meal prices (Table 7)

## Data

The dataset used in this replication is sourced from Card and Krueger's original survey of 410 fast-food restaurants. The public-use dataset is available through the [Card and Krueger data archive](https://davidcard.berkeley.edu/data_sets.html) hosted by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER).

### Key Variables

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `state` | 1 = New Jersey, 0 = Pennsylvania |
| `chain` | Restaurant chain (Burger King, KFC, Roy Rogers, Wendy's) |
| `co_owned` | 1 = company-owned, 0 = franchisee-owned |
| `fte_before` | FTE employment in wave 1 (full-time + 0.5 × part-time) |
| `fte_after` | FTE employment in wave 2 |
| `wage_before` | Starting wage in wave 1 |
| `wage_after` | Starting wage in wave 2 |
| `gap` | Proportional wage increase needed to reach $5.05 (0 for PA stores) |
| `price_before` | Price of a full meal in wave 1 |
| `price_after` | Price of a full meal in wave 2 |
| `closed` | 1 = store permanently closed by wave 2 |

## Methodology

The primary identification strategy is a **difference-in-differences** design comparing employment changes at New Jersey restaurants (treatment) to Pennsylvania restaurants (control) before and after the minimum wage increase. An alternative within-state comparison uses the **initial wage gap** — the proportional raise required for a store to comply with the $5.05 minimum — as a continuous treatment intensity measure. Stores already paying at or above $5.00 serve as an internal control group within New Jersey.

FTE employment is defined as: `FTE = full-time workers (including managers) + 0.5 × part-time workers`. Employment at permanently closed stores is set to zero; temporarily closed stores are treated as missing in the baseline specification.
